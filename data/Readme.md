# README

See [logD_final.txt](./logD_final.txt) for final data values.

See `docs/index.html` on your local computer for formatted documentation of the analysis.

The script `process_data.py` generates the `processed.xlsx` spreadsheet including two sheets, one with filtered data, and one that includes the excluded data points.

This spreadsheet contains important metadata relevant to the analysis, including some that is not available in the raw data files.

Raw data is included in

    150917-Batch1Set1-wk38-BAS.txt
    150923-Batch1Set2-wk39-BAS.txt
    150924-Batch1Set1-wk39-BAS.txt
    150925-STD-wk39-BAS.txt
    
These include datapoints that were excluded, which are described in `excluded_samples.txt`, and don't contain all necessary metadata.
