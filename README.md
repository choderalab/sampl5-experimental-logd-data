## Description

As part of the [SAMPL5 challenge](https://drugdesigndata.org/about/sampl5), cyclohexane-water distribution coefficients (Log D) have been measured at Genentech for 53 small, drug-like molecules. The technique used is a mass spectrometry-based assay as described in [Lin & Pease, 2013](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24168238).

Inside this repository you will find raw and processed data files containing the experimental data that was collected, the [final results](./data/logD_final.txt) as well as the python scripts used to analyze the data.
