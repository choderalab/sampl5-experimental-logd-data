## Description

As part of the [SAMPL5 challenge](https://drugdesigndata.org/about/sampl5), cyclohexane-water distribution coefficients (Log D) have been measured at Genentech for 53 small, drug-like molecules. The technique used is a mass spectrometry-based assay as described in [Lin & Pease, 2013](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24168238).

Inside this repository you will find raw and processed data files containing the experimental data that was collected, the [final results](./data/logD_final.txt) as well as the python scripts used to analyze the data.


## Files

See [logD_final.txt](./logD_final.txt) for final data values, generated by [`analysis.py`](./analysis.py).

The experimental data that was used for the analysis is found in [`processed.xlsx`](./processed.xlsx).
    
Additionally, unprocessed, raw data files are found in [`raw_data`](./raw_data).

See [`docs`](https://rawgit.com/choderalab/sampl5-experimental-logd-data/master/docs/index.html?token=ADyyA7hQfY53bbxeiJ_qNT-ZdQSjTnlBks5WzhviwA%3D%3D) for a documentation of the analysis.
